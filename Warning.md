Trojan V – Advanced Custom Trojan Framework for Educational Use
Trojan V is a purpose-built, open-source trojan framework developed by /inroot corporation to provide a comprehensive, transparent platform for studying the inner workings of modern trojan malware. This project aims to facilitate hands-on learning for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and students by exposing the architecture, techniques, and behavioral patterns commonly employed by real-world trojans.

Overview
Trojan V is engineered with a modular and extensible architecture that simulates advanced malware features such as stealth persistence mechanisms, encrypted command and control communication, and customizable payload execution. The codebase is carefully documented to support reverse engineering, forensic analysis, and defensive research.

This project is designed explicitly for educational, ethical, and lawful use only. It offers a safe environment to examine trojan behavior without deploying any active malicious payloads.
